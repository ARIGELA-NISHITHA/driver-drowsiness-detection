## Overview
This project detects driver drowsiness in real-time using deep learning. It monitors:
- Eye closure (open/closed)
- Yawning (mouth open/closed)

## Folder Structure
- `datasets/` : CEW and YawDD images
- `models/` : Trained CNN models
- `scripts/` : Training and detection scripts
- `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` : Facial landmark model
- `alarm.wav` : Alert sound

## How to Run
1. Train CNN models:
